    return (
        <>

            <div> My name is {name} </div> 
            <button onClick={focus}> Focus </button>
        </>

}
// so now whenever our input ref gets rendered on the screen

```js

        </>
    )
}
// if u using state for example when u wanted to set previous name instead of a state variable
// it would cause your component to re-render again but by using refs here we're not causing
